      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really proud that I successfully did my first open-source contribution to a &amp;ldquo;relevant&amp;rdquo; project. While trying to create a swagger client library for the dart language, I noticed, that the generated code wasn&amp;rsquo;t working for Flutter. The reason for this is the lack of dart:mirrors support in the flutter framework. The generated code was using dartson which relies on dart:mirrors.
I reworked the dart client that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t rely on dartson, but works without any further dependencies (pull request).</description>
